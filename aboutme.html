    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here? I'm working towards becoming a veterinarian or a private investigator for crimes and becoming a better version of myself, I love being around animals and as far of becoming a private investigator I have the right attitude to become one. 
How am I working toward these goals?I'm working towards these goals by staying focused and staying on the right path to maintain these goals because I want to prove to the people that doubted me that I did it.
What values do I consider most necessary for my success?My education and my attitude, even though its very hard for me I still manage to push myself through it because I believe I can do it.
What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future?Having a good paying job, and getting my diploma after I graduate.
What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for?I want to be known as a person who cares more for people around her more than herself, and to be known as someone who doesn't give up no matter how hard the situation can be.
